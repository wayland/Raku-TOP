# First Iteration Tasks
-	Module ready to use; publicise
	-	Announce on #raku
	-	Link to it from my TOP site -- maybe start replacing parts of Raku TOP with the doco I've written
-	Rewrite https://wayland.github.io/table-oriented-programming/Raku-TOP/Introduction.xml so that:
	-	The TODO list is a separate page
	-	The TODO list below (aka Iterations) is incorporated into it
-	Clean up browser tabs relating to TOP
-	Start next coding iteration

# Iterations
-	Look at the TODO items in the code
-	General thought -- pick up on the Spreadsheet one (because it's so different), then start working on
	new features
-	cf. also https://wayland.github.io/table-oriented-programming/Raku-TOP/Introduction.xml
-	Spreadsheet (OpenOffice format)
-	CSV
-	HTML
-	Human-only (output-only) & half-human (input/output)
-	Or should I backend onto those other 2 things (Dan and DataQueryWorkflows)

# Per-iteration tasks:
-	Write some code so that things work
-	Get the tests working with it
-	Write POD and comments, and clean up
-	Commit to git
-	Review/Upload/Publicise to the fez ecosystem

# On hold
-	Once Pod documentation is done, see if we can use it to generate a README
	-	On hold until I upgrade Raku on my local

# Changelog
# 0.0.1
DONE	Put in a copy of the artistic license; see if we can do dual license (Artistic + GPL)
DONE	Finish off tests for Memory and Postgres types
DONE	Write github tests based on DBIish (but comment out lots)
DONE	Write Pod doco
DONE	Go through and remove all the extraneous code
DONE	Register with zef/fez: https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#Upload_your_module_to_zef_ecosystem
DONE	Investigate registering with raku.land (so I can upload modules) -- uploading to fez might be enough
