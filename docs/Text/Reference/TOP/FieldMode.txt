TOP::FieldMode

The objects descended from this are the ones that action Table!field-mode

  Attributes

    .vet-for-tuple and friends

This is where the field modes are implemented. It's been designed so that,
if someone wants to add a new field mode, they should be able to do so just
by implementing the following methods:

  * process-extra-fields-hash

  * process-extra-fields-array

  * get-field-names

Note that each of the above is passed $!field-mode as the first parameter,
and this selects the appropriate field mode. 

Possibly in future, each field-mode should instead be a class with all
these methods attached.
