    class    TOP::Formatter::HalfHuman {



The class for formatting the tables in a half-human format. Half-Human is a
format Tim Nelson designed. It's basically the same as the output of many
Unix/Linux commands, but a little more standardised, so that computers can
process them as easily as humans.. In particular, the rules are:

  * All columns are whitespace-separated (standard)

  * No columns may have spaces (suggestion: replace with underlines)

  * No column be completely blank (suggestion: If there's no value, put a
  dash)

Many of the functions in this class are called by
Database::Driver::format()
